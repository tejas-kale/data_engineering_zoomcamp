# Data Engineering Zoomcamp

This repository contains my work for the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) course. The directory structure is as follows:
- `homework`: contains the homework assignments for each week.
- `requirements.txt`: contains the Python packages required to run the code in this repository.
