## Course Code
This directory contains the code from the course. The code is organized by week and video. The code is written in Python and executing it will generate the Postgres database that is used to store the data. The Parquet file used in `01_docker_postgres` can be found [here](https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2023-06.parquet).
